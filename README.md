## Overview
__CRAIN (Cyber Report Automation INtegration)__ is a  a tool that aims at automating report generation process for client deliverable for multiple Cyber Security activities such as Web & Mobile App Security testing, Source code review et al.
The tool helps in increasing efficiency of employees in the report generation process and standardizes the quality of the deliverables.
This is done by fetching a prebuilt set of observations from a centralized observation database and providing an interface to the users to select/update the observation depending on the requirement of the project.
The final Excel report contains all the observations and related screenshots properly arranged and formatted, ready to be delivered to the client. 

__Note:__
- This repository only contains the desktop application code for CRAIN.
- The observation database and API code (Second part of CRAIN) is not available publicly as it is proprietary.
- The desktop application shall not work without receiving inputs from the backend API.
